# Leadership Manifesto

1. I lead with trust, accountability, and a strong bias toward growth.
2. My style is blameless and collaborative. If something goes wrong, I treat it as a team learning opportunity, not a personal failure.
3. I see it as my job to make sure expectations are clear, the team has what they need, and everyone has room to grow.
4. In security-conscious or regulated environments, a blameless culture matters even more. People need to feel safe speaking up when something seems off—or when they’ve made a mistake. That’s how we catch issues early and keep improving instead of hiding problems.
5. When someone on the team is struggling, I don’t start with formal plans. I start by looking at how our systems—meetings, planning, story assignments—might not be working for them, and I adjust.
6. I give direct, consistent feedback. Praise is public and fast. Constructive feedback is private and honest. I make space for real conversations in our 1:1s.
7. I’ll step in to help when needed, but I’ll make sure my teammate owns the win.
8. I split my time about 60/40 between technical work and the people/strategy side. I still love solving hard problems, but I get just as much out of watching someone on my team level up or knock out something they used to struggle with.
