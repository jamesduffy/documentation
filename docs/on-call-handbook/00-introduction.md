# Introduction

> This is based on the [On-call Handbook](https://github.com/alicegoldfuss/oncall-handbook/tree/master), but updated to fit my preference for On-Call.

Is this your first time on-call? Or, perhaps not your first rodeo, but you want to see what others are doing with theirs? You're in the right place.

While on-call shouldn't be a soul-destroying experience, some rotations are heavier than others, and there are things you can do to make your life easier.

This is a collection of tips and tricks to get you through your rotation from people who have been there.
